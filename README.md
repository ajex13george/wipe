Wireless Pentesting Learning Platform

A comprehensive educational project focused on wireless penetration testing concepts and simulations. This repository covers everything from Wi-Fi fundamentals and the 4-way handshake to monitor mode, packet capture, and attack demonstrations in a safe lab environment. It includes interactive simulations, structured learning content (basic to advanced), and practical workflows to help understand how wireless networks operate and how they are tested for security vulnerabilities.
